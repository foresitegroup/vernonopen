      The Daniel Kleiman Fund at <a href="https://my.aurorahealthcare.org/ahc/portal/find-a-location/locationDetail/hospital/aurora-st-lukes-medical-center" target="new">Aurora St. Luke's</a> is an organization that funds research into the cause and cure for this killer disease. All the money raised from the Vernon Open is donated directly to them in Danny's memory. The Vernon Open has raised more than $100,000 since it began in 2003. We hope you'll join us this year because The Daniel Kleiman Fund's success will be your success too.
