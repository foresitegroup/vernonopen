      <strong>Thank You</strong><br>
      Thank you to all for participating in last year's Vernon Open. With your support and generosity we have raised more than $100,000 donated to pancreatic cancer research over the years! We can not thank you all enough. This is such a tribute to Dan and we are honored.<br>

      VERNON OPEN 9 is just around the corner.  Mark your calendars for September 10, 2011.  We'll have a great time.  <a href="javascript:toggle('par1','par1link')" id="par1link">Read more...</a>

      VO 8 was a great success. Together we raised another $12,000, for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. That brings the total contribution from the Vernon Open to $94,000.  What a tribute to Danny and to your support and generosity!<br>
      <br>
      Planning for VO9 is well underway.  The place, as always, is Fire Ridge Golf Club in Grafton.  We promise the usual great golf, food, drink and fellowship.  And we're working on the weather angels.<br>
      <br>
      We're also gathering raffle and auction items, which are big money makers.  Of course if you can help please let us know.<br>
      <br>
      The need is greater every year.  The incidence of Pancreatic Cancer continues to increase.  More than 42,000 people will be diagnosed again this year.  The prognosis has not improved. Pancreatic Cancer is still the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths. The research is difficult and costly. We need your help.<br>
      <br>
      The Vernon Open is a NOT JUST FOR GOLFERS event.  The reception with its great buffet, awards ceremony, auction and raffle is open to all and kids are free.<br>
      <br>
      Mark your calendars now for September 10th. We're looking forward to seeing you all,  catching up on your lives and to making new memories.<br>
      <br>
      Have a great summer! &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="javascript:toggle('par1','par1link')">Read less...</a>
