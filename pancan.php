      The Pancreatic Cancer Network (PanCan) is the national organization that funds research into the cause and cure for this killer disease. All the money raised from the Vernon Open is donated directly to PanCan in Danny's memory. The Vernon Open has raised more than $70,000 since it began in 2003. We hope you'll join us this year because PanCan's success will be your success too.
